  <div class="about">
    <p>Hi, I'm Anastasia! Iâ€™m currently a developer for <a href="https://seesparkbox.com/" target="_blank">Sparkbox</a>. Outside of work, I'm the Secretary of <a href="http://pittsburgh.aiga.org/" target="_blank">AIGA Pittsburgh</a>, the professional association for design. I'm also the organizer for the CodePen Pittsburgh meetup and I'm an Chapter Leader for <a href="https://www.meetup.com/Girl-Develop-It-Pittsburgh/" target="_blanl">Girl Develop It Pittsburgh</a>.</p>

    <p>When I'm not doing meetups or event planning, I like hanging out with my pug and more recently attempting to play ice hockey.</p>
