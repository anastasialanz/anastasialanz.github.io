  <div class="about">
    <p>Hi, I'm Anastasia! Iâ€™m currently a developer for <a href="https://www.walltowall.com" target="_blank">Wall-to-Wall Studios</a>. Outside of work, I'm the Secretary of <a href="http://pittsburgh.aiga.org/" target="_blank">AIGA Pittsburgh</a>, the professional association for design. I'm also the organizer for the CodePen Pittsburgh meetup and I'm an Assistant Organizer for Girl Develop It.</p>

    <p>When I'm not doing meetups or event planning, I like hanging out with my pug and more recently attempting to play ice hockey.</p>
